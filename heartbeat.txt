Configuring the Heartbeat Parameters for UPF
This section describes how to configure the heartbeat feature for the UPF.

To configure the heartbeat feature for UPF at the interface-level, use the following configuration:

configure 
  endpoint pfcp 
  interface n4 
  heartbeat  
     interval interval 
     max-retransmissions max_retry 
     retransmission-timeout retry_count 
     end 
NOTES:

endpoint pfcp — Enters the endpoint configuration mode.

interface — Configures the N4 interface over which the heartbeat messages are exchanged between SMF and UPF.

heartbeat — Enters the heartbeat configuration.

interval interval — Specifies the heartbeat interval in seconds. The accepted range is 60–360. The default value is 60 seconds.

Setting the interval to "0", disables the heartbeat feature.

max-retransmissions max_retry — Specifies the maximum retries for the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) heartbeat request. The accepted range is 0–10. The default value is 3.

retransmission-timeout retry_count — Specifies the heartbeat retransmission timeout in seconds. The accepted range is 1–20. The default value is 5.
